## Welcome to My Professional Portfolio

This site serves as a professional portfolio designed [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ksray2/my-school-profile/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content of my achievements in Markdown files.

This Github Pages repository will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the page using Markdown content.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

This Pages site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme selected in [repository settings](https://github.com/ksray2/my-school-profile/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
